#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development of high-quality software systems. It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of high-level programming languages, such as C and Fortran, that allowed programmers to write code that was more readable for humans as opposed to hardware-specific coding helped improve coding productivity significantly. The formal introduction of software engineering as a discipline, emphasizing systematic approaches, documentation and quality control marked the transition of software development from an ad-hoc practice to a disciplined engineering process leading to the emergence of new methodologies such as waterfall development in order to create structured and phased approaches to software design.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The SDLC comprises of six main parts, namely the requirements gathering phase, which is the phase where user needs and system requirements are gathered and documented. Followed by the design phase where high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface are created. The next phase is the implementation phase, where the code is then written and the software is built according to the design specifications laid out in the design phase. The testing phase then follows where various tests such as user acceptance, integration and system tests are conducted to ensure the software meets quality standards and user requirements. The deployment phase then follows where the software is released to users or customers and the maintenance phase then continues to provide ongoing support, patch updates and enhancements in order to maintain the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a sequential software development approach with distinct phases such as requirements gathering, design and implementation with each stage needing to be fully complete before proceeding onto the next one and is useful for the development of a software with very rigid (unchanging) requirements. On the other hand, the agile methodology involves an iterative approach that is more focused on flexibility and collaboration and is most suited for projects where requirements might change, as the development process is not linear and allows for revision of steps that were previously done.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is the person responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. A quality assurance engineer is the dedicated team memeber that ensures the software's quality by designing and executing test plans while the project manager is the individual that oversees all the planning, execution and delivery of software projects, somewhat forming the bridge between the stakeholders and developers.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are software suites such as Visual Studio that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code, whereas Version Control Systems are software tools like Git that track changes to the cource code and facilitate coordinating work among team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers might face various problems such as revisions to the user requirements which might lead to scope creep thereby delaying release dates or resulting in compromised quality or usability due to rushed development in order to meet deadlines. Lastly, the development of software can result in debt accruing from the use of suboptimal solutions which can negatively impact future development efforts and increase software maintenance costs. Strategies to overcome these challenges comprise of effective communication between engineers and stakeholders, regular reassessment of project goals and timelines to ensure development is not rushed and quality is not compromised as well as prioritization of tasks such as developing critical modules and ensuring the system's core functionality and the implementation of iterative project management (agile methodologies) where projects are broken down into milestones with regular reviews and adjustments to adapt to changing requirements.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit testing involves tesing the individual modules of software and is important in software quality assurance as it helps identify any bugs and other code issues at an early stage of the software development cycle allowing for issues to be addressed before they develop into more complex problems in later stages of the development cycle.
integration testing involves testing the interactions between the different components or subsystems of the software, validating that these components work seamlessly together as a system to achieve the desired functionality and performance.
system testing involves testing the software system as a whole and asses the stability of the product at each stage of development and aids in identiffying code problems where any might persist.
acceptance testing involves testing the software against the pre-specifiedfunctional and non-functional user requirements to ensure that it meets the users needs, is reliable and user-friendly in order to minimise issues after deployment by identifying potential defects and usability problems through real user interaction.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the specific text instructions entered into the AI model's text bar, and is important in interactions with AI models as it affects the quality of responses generated by the model. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example of a vague prompt would be "What can I do better?" with an improvement of the prompt being offering context of the question asked such as "I am an aspiring author looking to enhance my writing abilities, what techniques can I use to write more engaging narratives?"
The more detailed and specific the prompt is, the higher quality and relevant the AI response will be. The more vague a prompt is, the lower the quality and usefulness of the response. The improved prompt is more effective as it narrows down the scope of the question in order for the AI model to give answers specific to a literature writing context.
